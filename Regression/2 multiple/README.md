# Multiple Regression Project

Welcome to the Multiple Regression Project!

This repository provides tools and templates for performing multiple regression analysis. Multiple regression extends simple linear regression by considering multiple independent variables, making it a powerful tool for understanding complex relationships in your data.

## Overview

Multiple regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. This project includes templates, example datasets, and code to help you perform and visualize multiple regression analyses.

## Features

- **Multiple Regression Templates**: Templates for setting up and running multiple regression analyses.
- **Example Dataset**: A sample dataset to practice and test the regression model.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tools to visualize the results of the regression analysis.
