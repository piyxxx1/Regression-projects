# Polynomial Regression Project

Welcome to the Polynomial Regression Project!

This repository provides tools and templates for performing polynomial regression analysis. Polynomial regression extends linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data, allowing for the modeling of non-linear relationships.

## Overview

Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables as an \(n\)th degree polynomial. This project includes templates, example datasets, and code to help you perform and visualize polynomial regression analyses.

## Features

- **Polynomial Regression Templates**: Templates for setting up and running polynomial regression analyses.
- **Example Dataset**: A sample dataset to practice and test the regression model.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tools to visualize the polynomial fit and data points.
