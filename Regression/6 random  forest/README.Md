# Random Forest Regression Project

Welcome to the Random Forest Regression Project!

This repository provides tools and templates for performing random forest regression analysis. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

## Overview
Random Forest Regression is a type of ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of several decision trees to predict continuous outcomes. By averaging the results of multiple trees, random forest reduces the risk of overfitting and improves predictive accuracy. This project includes templates, example datasets, and code to help you perform and visualize random forest regression analyses.

## Features
- **Random Forest Regression Templates**: Templates for setting up and running random forest regression analyses.
- **Example Dataset**: A sample dataset to practice and test the random forest regression model.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tools to visualize the individual trees, the ensemble model, and the regression fit.

This project structure offers a solid foundation for implementing random forest regression. You can enhance it by including resources on hyperparameter tuning (e.g., the number of trees, maximum depth), feature importance analysis, and parallel processing to further improve the model's performance and usability.
