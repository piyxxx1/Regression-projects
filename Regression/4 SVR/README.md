# Support Vector Regression (SVR) Project

Welcome to the Support Vector Regression (SVR) Project!

This repository provides tools and templates for performing support vector regression analysis. SVR is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) used for regression problems, allowing for the modeling of complex relationships by finding the best-fitting line within a defined margin of error.

## Overview
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a supervised learning model that is useful for predicting continuous values. Unlike linear regression, which aims to minimize the error, SVR tries to fit the best line within a predefined threshold. This project includes templates, example datasets, and code to help you perform and visualize SVR analyses.

## Features
- **Support Vector Regression Templates**: Templates for setting up and running support vector regression analyses.
- **Example Dataset**: A sample dataset to practice and test the SVR model.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tools to visualize the support vector regression fit and data points.
