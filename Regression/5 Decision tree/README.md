# Decision Tree Regression Project

Welcome to the Decision Tree Regression Project!

This repository provides tools and templates for performing decision tree regression analysis. Decision tree regression is a powerful non-linear regression technique that splits the data into branches to predict continuous outcomes.

## Overview
Decision Tree Regression is a type of model that predicts a target value by learning decision rules from features in the data. It works by splitting the dataset into branches, where each branch represents a decision rule. This project includes templates, example datasets, and code to help you perform and visualize decision tree regression analyses.

## Features
- **Decision Tree Regression Templates**: Templates for setting up and running decision tree regression analyses.
- **Example Dataset**: A sample dataset to practice and test the decision tree regression model.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tools to visualize the decision tree structure and the regression fit.

This structure provides a clear and organized approach to implementing decision tree regression. It can be further enriched with additional resources, such as hyperparameter tuning guides, pruning techniques, and advanced visualization tools to make the project more comprehensive.
