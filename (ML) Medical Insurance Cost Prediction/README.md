# Medical Cost Prediction Using Machine Learning and Linear Regression

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict medical costs using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on linear regression. The goal is to create a predictive model that can estimate medical expenses based on various input features. This can be useful for healthcare providers, insurance companies, and individuals to better understand and manage healthcare costs.

## Problem Statement

Healthcare costs have been rising steadily, and accurately predicting these expenses is crucial for budgeting and financial planning. In this project, we address the problem of estimating medical costs based on various attributes such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and more. By leveraging machine learning, specifically linear regression, we aim to develop a model that can predict medical costs with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies have been used in this project:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and model implementation.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library used for handling and preprocessing the dataset.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations that assists in handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A machine learning library that provides tools for building and evaluating the linear regression model.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library built on Matplotlib, used for creating informative and attractive data visualizations.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used for visualizing data and model performance.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for developing and documenting the machine learning workflow.
